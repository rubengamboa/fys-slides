## Lists

* A **list** lets you store zero or more items in a variable
* Examples:
  * [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
  * [Ruben, Gamboa, W3850128, 100000000]
  * [four, score, and, seven, years, ago, ...]
  * [ [Calculus I, 4, A], [English Composition, 3, B], [Physics I, 4, B] ]

* You can build and process lists with the blocks
  * Variables > list
  * Variables > length of L
  * Variables > item X of L
  * Variables > replace item X of L with Y
  * Variables > insert Y at X of L
  * . . . .

## Using Lists

* Store different data related to one entity
  * [Ruben, Gamboa, W3850128, 100000000]

* Define your own blocks to provide **abstraction**
  * Employee with *First Name*, *Last Name*, *W-number*, and *Salary*
  * First Name of *Employee*
  * Last Name of *Employee*
  * W-number of *Employee*
  * Salary of *Employee*
  * Change First Name of *Employee* to *New First Name*
  * Change Last Name of *Employee* to *New Last Name*
  * Change W-number of *Employee* to *New W-number*
  * Change Salary of *Employee* to *New Salary*

## Using Lists

* Store zero or more of the same king of thing
  * [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  * [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
  * [Ruben, Gamboa, W3850128, 100000000]
  * [four, score, and, seven, years, ago, ...]
  * [ [Calculus I, 4, A], [English Composition, 3, B], [Physics I, 4, B] ]

* To process this, we may want to
  * Go through all the elements to summarize some value
  * Go through all the elements of the list to find something we want
  * Transform all elements of a list
  * Filter the elements of the list

---

## Using Lists: Summarizing a Value

          set SUM to 0
          set I to 1
          repeat until I > length of L
              set SUM to SUM + item I of L
              set I to I+1
          report SUM


          set MAX to 0
          set I to 1
          repeat until I > length of L
              if item I of L > MAX
                  set MAX to item I of L
              set I to I+1
          report MAX

## Using Lists: Finding an Element

          set I to 1
          repeat until I > length of L
              if item I of L is the one I want
                  report item I of L
              set I to I+1
          report error

---

## Using Lists: Transforming all Elements of a List

          set I to 1
          NewList = list
          repeat until I > length of L
              insert 2 * item I of L at I of NewList
              set I to I+1
          report NewList

---

## Using Lists: Filtering a List

          I = 1
          NewList = list
          repeat until I > length of L
              if item I of L is one of the ones I want
                  insert item I of L at last of NewList
              set I to I+1
          report NewList

## Part 1

* Build the following blocks, which use lists to represent a course in your schedule, e.g., [Calculus I, 4, A]
  for the Calculus I course, with 4 credit hours, in which you got a A
  * Course *Course Name* with *Credits* credits and a grade of *Grade*
  * Course Name of *Course*
  * Credits of *Course*
  * Grade of *Course*
  * Change Course Name of *Course* to *New Course Name*
  * Change Credits of *Course* to *New Credits*
  * Change Grade of *Course* to *New Course*


---

## Part 2

* Build these blocks
  * **Product** of all elements in list L
  * **Smallest** element of list L
  * **Square** each element of list L
  * List of all elements of L that are **Prime**

---

## Part 3

* Built a block called "GPA of *courses*" that will go through a list of courses and compute your GPA

        set Courses to list Course "Calculus I" with 4 credits and a grade of A,
                            Course "English Composition" with 3 credits and a grade of B,
                            Course "Physics I" with 4 credits and a grade of B
        say GPA of Courses for 2 secs

* This program should say 3.3636 (because $\frac{4\cdot4 + 3\cdot3 + 4\cdot3}{4+3+4} = 3.3636$)
