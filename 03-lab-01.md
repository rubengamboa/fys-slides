## Creating an Account

* Go to http://snap.berkeley.edu

* Click on the big, orange button that says **Run Snap! now!**

* When *Snap!* comes up, click on the cloud icon in the top navigation bar

* Select *Signup...* from the cloud icon, and follow the steps to create an account

* You will need to check your e-mail to get the temporary password for your account

* Then you can select *Login...* to login

* Don't forget to change your password!

## Changing the Costume

* Select *File > Costumes...* from the top navigation bar

* Pick a costume!
  * Alternatively, create your own image, take a picture, or find your own images in the web
  * You can import images using *File > Import...*

* Duplicate the image by right-clicking the image under the *Costumes* tab in the center region
  * Note: I want two costumes on the same avatar, not two avatars
  * So duplicate the costume in the center panel, not the avatar in the right panel

* Edit one the costumes so you have one that points left and one that points right
  * Use the *flip &lt;->* button so that it points in the opposite direction

* Now write a program that changes the costume when the user clicks on the sprite
  * Control > When I am clicked
  * Looks > Next costume

---

## Save Your Work

* Save Early, Save Often!

* Click *File > Save* in the top navigation bar

* Give the project a name that you can remember

* We want to save to the Cloud

* If that doesn't work, let me know!

---

## Moving at Random

* Add to your program so that the sprite moves randomly when you click on it
  * Operators > Pick random ... to ...
  * Motion > Go to x: ... y: ...

* The sprite should move *as well as* changing the costume, so don't delete your work from before

* You may find it useful to display the current position and direction of the sprite, so you can see it
  * Motion > X position
  * Motion > Y position
  * Motion > Direction

---

## Being Friendly

* Say something nice when the green flag is clicked to start
  * Control > When green flag clicked
  * Looks > Say

* Clear what you say when the sprite is clicked

* Have the sprite move over and over after it is clicked
  * Control > Forever
  * Control > Wait ... secs

* **Note:** More than one block can be running at a time, but each block can only run once, so the next time you
  click on the sprite it stops and starts the "clicked" block again from the top

---

## Submit Your Code!

* To submit, use the *File > Save* to save your file

* Then hit the *Share* button to make it available to others

* Click *File > Open* to reopen your (now shared) project

* This changes the URL in your browser

* Submit the (shared) URL via WyoCourses

---

## Finish Early?

* Awesome! Try out the [BJC Hour of Code](http://bjc.edc.org/hourofcode/#1 "BJC Hour of Code")

* You do not have to complete (or even start) the Hour of Code for this lab, 
  but you may not leave early unless you do

* And before you leave, check with me so that I know the project is shared correctly
