## Making Your Own Blocks

* In the *Variables* section, there is a button that lets you build your own block

* You can place the block into any of the categories, e.g., Motion, Control, ...

* You can also create three types of blocks
  * Command - does something
  * Reporter - returns some value
  * Predicate - returns *true* or *false*

* After you give the block a name (which should be a phrase), you can change some words into input fields

## Part 1

* Build three blocks!

* **Polygon** with N sides of length L
  Note: Think carefully -- should this command move around a polygon, or should it draw a polygon?

* **Area** of circle with radius R

* Is N **prime**?
  * Note: N is prime if N >= 2, N mod 2 = 0, N mod 3 = 0, ..., and N mod (N-1) = 0

---

## Part 2

* Consider your solutions to Lab 3

* There are many opportunities to build your own blocks, to make your program easier to understand

* E.g., Each separate random walk of the Solar Photons can be its own block, and another block of code can keep track of the
  averages

* E.g., the computation for the profit of a call option can be its own block

* And so on....

* Give some serious thought to the way your program can be broken down into blocks, and recode your solution to labs 3

* Note: You do not have to start from scratch!  Take your existing solutions and move some blocks around.  
  But move the blocks purposefully!
