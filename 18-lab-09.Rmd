## Recursive Reporters and Recursive Commands

* So far, we've focused on **Recursive Reporters**
* These blocks use recursion to find a value, e.g., the minimum of a list

<br>
<br>

* Today, we'll look at **Recursive Commands**
* I.e., we'll move the turtle using recursion

---

## The Secret

* Writing recursive commands that move the turtle can be very tricky
* The secret is to be very clear about
  * Where the turtle is supposed to end
  * What direction the turtle should be pointing at when it ends
* If you keep that straight, even the mistakes will be fun!

## Demos

1. Triangles
2. More Triangles
3. Snowflake
4. Tree

---

## Lab

* Build a tree!
* This can be just like the one in the demos
* But be creative
  * More branches?
  * Variety?
  * Can it look like a real tree, e.g., a spruce?
