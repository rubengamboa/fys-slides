## Why You Should Use Script Variables

* We wrote SUM last time using the (global) variable I to look at each element of the array

* We also wrote SQUARE last time using the (global) variable I to look at each element of the array

* What happens if you try

        SUM of SQUARE of _L_

* Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't

* Don't leave it up to chance!

## Why You Should Use Script Variables, Part 2

* Suppose we have a list of lists of numbers (like a matrix)

        [ [ 1 2 3]
          [ 4 5 6] ]

* We want the sum of all the elements of all lists

        set _I_ to 1
        set _total_ to 0
        repeat until _I_ > length _Matrix_
            set _total_ to _total_ + SUM of (item _I_ of _Matrix_)
        report _total_

* Moral: From now on, use **script variable** instead of **Make a variable** inside blocks (aka scripts)

## Lab Exercises

* Create a new variable called **shared document**
  * Set **shared document** to a list of 8 numbers between 1 and 100
* Create a new variable called **original message**
  * Set **original message** to a random list of 8 numbers between 1 and 10
* Create a block called **render _image_** that draws a line with the colors in the image (which is a list of numbers)
* Create a block called **hide *message* in _document_** that adjusts the _document_ by the 0 or 1 in _message_
* Create a block called **recover *message* in _document_** that gets back the hidden message
