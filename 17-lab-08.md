## Why We Really Need Recursion

* So far, we've been doing examples where recursion is just as good as using a loop

        Sum of Elements of L
            Script Variable I SUM
            set I to 0
            set SUM to 0
            repeat until I > length of L
                set SUM to SUM + item I of L
                set I to I + 1
            report SUM

        Sum of Elements of L
            if L is empty
                report 0
            report item 1 of L + (Sum of Elements of (all but first of L))

## Recursion = Loop?

* So you're forgiven for thinking that recursion is the same as a loop
* In fact, recursion is much more powerful

        X Is a Blue Blooded Frenchman
            if X Is A Certified BBF
                report true
            if Father of X Is Known and Mother of X Is Known
                report (    (Father of X) Is a Blue Blooded Frenchman
                        and (Mother of X) Is a Blue Blooded Frenchman)
            report false

* Notice we call Blue Blooded Frenchman *twice* in the definition
* Once you can replace by a loop
* But twice is a lot trickier to do without recursion

## Sorting

* Sorting is an old, important (and solved) problem in computing
* Sorting means to rearrange a list so that its elements are in order
* I.e., sorting [2, 6, 4, 1] results in [1, 2, 4, 6]

---

## Quicksort

* Quicksort is one of the most famous algorithms in the world
* It's easy to express using recursion, and nearly impossible without it

        Quicksort L
            if length of L <= 1
                report L
            Script Variables L1 L2
            Set L1 to (Elements of (all but first of L) Smaller than (item 1 of L))
            Set L2 to (Elements of (all but first of L) Not Smaller than (item 1 of L))
            Set L1 to (Quicksort L1)
            Set L2 to (Quicksort L2)
            report Append L1 ((item 1 of L) in front of L2)

* Append? That just puts all of the elements of one list, then all the elements of the next list
* E.g., Append of [1, 2, 3] and [5, 7] is [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
* It's easy to do with recursion (and without) -- try it!

## Part 1

* We will store information about fathers in a list as follows:

        [ [Kal-El, Jor-El II],
          [Don-El, Nim-El],
          [Kara Zor-El, Zor-El],
          [Zor-El, Jor-El I],
          [Nim-El, Jor-El I],
          [Zor-El II, Jor-El I]
        ]

* I.e., the father of Kal-El is Jor-El II, and the father of Den-El is Nim-El, and so on

* Write the block "Parent of _X_ from _Parents_" that will return the father of _X_ if _Parents_
  is the list above

* If _X_ does not have a parent (in the list _Parents_), then this should return "NONE"

---

## Part 2

* Using the fathers list in the previous slide and the block "Parent of _X_ from _Parents_",
  we can find the parents of prominent Kryptonians

* We need mothers, too

* But that's as easy as writing down the mothers list below and using the same block

        [ [Kal-El, Lara Lor-Van],
          [Don-El, Dondra Klu-Ta],
          [Kara Zor-El, Alura In-Zee],
          [Zor-El, Nimda An-Dor],
          [Nim-El, Nimda An-Dor],
          [Zor-El II, Nimda An-Dor]
        ]

* Be sure you can use your block to find the father *and* mother of Kal-El and Kara Zor-El
* You should also use your block to find that Ruben does not have any Kryptonian parents
* Oh, and neither do Jor-El I or Nimda An-Dor!  (What does that tell you?)

---

## Part 3

* Here is a list of Beloved Kryptonians

        [ Jor-El I, Zor-El, Alura In-Zee, Dondra Klu-Ta, Jor-El II, Lara Lor-Van ]

* Write a block called "X Is in list L" that checks whether X is in the list L or not

* E.g., Dondra Klu-Ta is the list of Beloved Kryptonians

* Alas! Ruben is not in the list of Beloved Kryptonians

---

## Part 4

* You know the rule:

* X is a Beloved Kryptonian if either
  * X is in the list of Beloved Kryptonians, or
  * Both of X's parents are known and they are both Beloved Kryptonians

* Are Kal-El and Kara Zor-El Beloved Kryptonians?  How about Don-El?

* Write a block called "X Is a Beloved Kryptonian" to answer the questions
