## Growth Mindset

* One of the ideas that comes up in the TED Talk is **growth mindset**

* This appears to explain many differences in the outcomes of people with similar abilities

* **Fixed Mindset:**
  * My intelligence/charisma/whatever is a fixed quantity that I got at birth
  * My chances for success are fixed at birth
  * To be successful, I must show that I have enough intelligence/charisma/whatever
  * If I'm failing or having to work hard, that's a bad sign

* **Growth Mindset:**
  * My abilities can improve over time
  * I can learn from my mistakes
  * Eventually, I'll be able to accomplish my goals
  * If I'm failing or having to work hard, that means I'm learning

## Getting a Growth Mindset

> * Children as young as 4 already break down into "fixed" or "growth" mindsets

> * Does that mean that our "mindset" is fixed and we can't do anything about it?

> * Of course not! That wouldn't be very "growth mindset-y", would it?

> * Experiments show that how people praise or reward us can change our mindset

> * We can take explicit steps to change our mindset, too:
